### Project Overview:
This project focuses on exploring and classifying exoplanets using machine learning (ML) techniques.

- **Project Pipeline:**
    - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
        - The project visualizes the data and detects for anomalies based on which it makes certain assessments.
        - The data is further cleaned and processed so as to make it suitable for model training.
    - **Modeling:**
        - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is used here for classification.
        - **Performance Metrics:**
            - Evaluated using ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves.
            - AUC (Area Under the Curve) is computed to assess the model's classification accuracy.
            - Confusion Matrix is used to analyze the performance of the classification model.
    - **Handling Data Imbalance:**
        - SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) is applied to handle class imbalance and improve model performance.
          
### Ending notes:
   - The following project is my first machine-learning project so for certain concepts I have also linked ytvideos(inline-comments) that I have referred to, for better understanding of the project
